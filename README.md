# E-commerce-Product-Delivery-Prediction
Develope robust machine learning models to accurately predict product delivery timeliness. By utilizing these models, the company aims to improve customer satisfaction, optimize logistics, and gain insights into factors affecting delivery performance.

## **Introduction** 
In today’s highly competitive e-commerce market, customer retention is essential for long-term business success and sustainable growth. 
This project aims to enhance the understanding of product delivery patterns and customer behaviour for an international e-commerce company specializing in electronic products. 
The goal is to develop robust machine learning models to accurately predict product delivery timeliness, enabling the company to improve customer satisfaction, optimize logistics, and gain insights into factors affecting delivery performance.
The dataset used includes customer care calls, customer rating, prior purchases, Mode of Shipments, Cost of the Product, Product Importance, Weight etc.

## **Data Preprocessing**
* **Checked for missing values:  No missing data was found.**
* **Detecting and removing Outlier (Weight in gms).**
* **Converted categorical features to numerical using encoding (Label encoding for Gender, Warehouse Block, Product Importance, Mode of shipment).**
* **Normalized Numerical features (Cost of the Product, Discount Offered, Weight in gms, Customer care call, Customer Ratings).**
* **Split data into training (75%) and testing (25%) sets for model building. **
